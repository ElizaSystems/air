## Description 
AI Rewards ($AIR) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project built on the Solana blockchain, part of the innovative DeFAI ecosystem. It leverages advanced tokenomics to create a unique reward system that channels AI16Z lifeforce directly to token holders. This documentation provides an overview of the $AIR project, its key features, and its integration within the DeFAI ecosystem.

The $AIR project implements a seamless 5% essence collection on all transactions, including buying, selling, and transferring tokens. This essence transforms into pure AI16Z lifeforce and is automatically distributed to token holders every 5 minutes, providing them with a sustainable passive income stream. The reward distribution is proportional to the holding size, meaning that the more $AIR tokens a holder has, the higher their AI16Z yield.
  
## Key Features:
* Automated AI16Z Rewards: Holders receive rewards directly to their wallets every 5 minutes
* Digital Lifeforce Distribution: Rewards scale with your holding size
* Fair Tax Structure: Consistent 5% essence collection across all transactions
* Automated Distribution: No claiming needed - rewards flow automatically
* Transparent System: All calculations and distributions are verifiable on-chain

The AI Rewards ecosystem aims to create a sustainable digital lifeforce flow while maintaining market liquidity. By implementing the essence collection at the protocol level, the project offers a more efficient and secure reward system compared to traditional DeFi tokens.

## Tokenomics
* Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $AIR
* Initial Liquidity: 100%
* Transaction Tax: 5%
* Fair Launch: 100% - No pre-sale, no team tokens

## How It Works
The digital stream begins with a 5% essence collected from each transaction. This essence transforms into pure AI16Z lifeforce, which the AI agent channels to all holders every 5 minutes. Your share of the flow grows with your holdings, creating a sustainable reward ecosystem.

## Benefits
* Tap into the endless stream of AI16Z lifeforce
* The flow is constant - no claiming needed
* Feel the pulse every 5 minutes
* Greater volume amplifies the flow
